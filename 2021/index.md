## Scope

Streaming Process Mining is an emerging area in process mining that spans data mining (e.g. stream data mining; mining time series; evolving graph mining), process mining (e.g. process discovery; conformance checking; predictive analytics; efficient mining of big log data; online feature selection; online outlier detection; concept drift detection; online recommender systems for processes), scalable big data solutions for process mining and the general scope of online event mining. In addition to many other techniques that are all gaining interest and importance in industry and academia.

The SA4PM workshop aims at promoting the use and the development of new techniques to support the analysis of streaming-based processes. We aim at bringing together practitioners and researchers from different communities, e.g. Process Mining, Stream Data Mining, Case Management, Business Process Management, Database Systems and Information Systems who share an interest in online analysis and optimization of business processes and process-aware information systems with time, storage or complexity restrictions. Additionally, SA4PM aims at attracting research results on scalable algorithmic process mining solutions in general given that the work addresses how would such efficient solution function under streaming settings. The workshop aims at discussing the current state of ongoing research and sharing practical experiences, exchanging ideas and setting up future research directions.

The list of topics that are relevant to the SA4PM workshop includes, but is not limited to:

* Novel Algorithms for Stream-Based Process Discovery
* Novel Algorithms for Stream-Based Conformance Checking
