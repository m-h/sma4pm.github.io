## Guidelines

Authors should submit original, unpublished research papers. All papers must not simultaneously be submitted to another journal or conference. Submitted papers should have a **maximum length of 12 pages** and must be written in English. The abstract is expected to include a relevance indication to the scope of the workshop.

Submitters are **required** to indicate if their data and software is publicly available and if so, where and if not, why not. Sharing both data and software is important for the development of the research area as a whole. We expect this low-impact demand will increase the visibility of our work and the availability of data and software to other researchers.

Authors are requested to prepare submissions according to the format of the [Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series by Springer](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0).

## Submission link

Papers and abstracts should be submitted through the Easy Chair web site in PDF format: <https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icpm2021>.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of them will register to the conference and present the paper. Registrations are managed by the ICPM 2021 registration system (<https://icpmconference.org/2021/registration/>). Only papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference will be published in the conference proceedings.
