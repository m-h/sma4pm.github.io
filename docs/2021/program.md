We are excited to announce that Matthias Weidlich will be the Keynote Speaker of SA4PM'21. This is the abstract of his keynote:

!!! info "Abstract of: From Complex Event Recognition to Processes and Back – A Reflection on Existing Solutions and Open Challenges"

    The integration of complex event recognition and models that guide the design and analysis of processes is beneficial for various reasons. Complex event recognition supports the abstraction of event data to conduct process mining; it enriches the expressiveness of process models in terms of the specification of events that steer process execution; and it enables monitoring of processes or even their enactment. Information on processes, in turn, is valuable to optimize the evaluation of queries for complex event recognition. In this talk, I review scenarios and respective solutions for the integration of complex event recognition and process management, and point to open research questions in the area.
