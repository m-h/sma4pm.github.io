## Scope

Streaming Process Mining is an emerging area in process mining that spans data mining (e.g. stream data mining; mining time series; evolving graph mining), process mining (e.g. process discovery; conformance checking; predictive analytics; efficient mining of big log data; online feature selection; online outlier detection; concept drift detection; online recommender systems for processes), scalable big data solutions for process mining and the general scope of online event mining. In addition to many other techniques that are all gaining interest and importance in industry and academia.

After a very successful two runs on this workshop together with ICPM 2020 in ICPM 2021, this workshop aims at further promoting the use and the development of new techniques to support the analysis of streaming-based processes. We aim at bringing together practitioners and researchers from different communities, e.g. Process Mining, Stream Data Mining, Case Management, Business Process Management, Database Systems and Information Systems who share an interest in online analysis and optimization of business processes and process-aware information systems with time, storage or complexity restrictions. The workshop aims at discussing the current state of ongoing research and sharing practical experiences, exchanging ideas and setting up future research directions.

The list of topics that are relevant to the SA4PM workshop includes, but is not limited to:

* Novel Algorithms for Stream-Based Process Discovery
* Novel Algorithms for Stream-Based Conformance Checking
* Novel Algorithms for Stream-Based Compliance Checking
* Online Predictive Analytics
* Online Recommender Systems
* Online Case-Adaptation Techniques
* Online Decision Mining
* Online Recommender Systems for Processes
* Real-Time Process Mining
* Online Concept Drift Detection
* Online Outlier Detection
* Solutions for Process Mining & Big Data
* Streaming Feature Selection Methods for High-Dimensional Log Files
* Streaming Trace Clustering Methods
* Architectures for Distributed Process Mining (from algorithmic perspective)
* Architectures for Distributed Storage of Event Data
* Adoption of Process Mining in Scalable Big Data/Streaming Solution (e.g. Apache Hadoop/Spark)
* Evaluation Methods of Streaming Process Mining Algorithms
* Visualization Methods for Streaming Process Mining Results
* Applications/Case-Studies of the Application of Online Process Mining
* Process Monitoring
* Online Event Mining
* Graph Evolution Mining Methods for Process Mining
* Time Series Mining Methods for Process Mining
* Methodological Aspects of Online Process Mining
* Fundamental Aspects of Online Process Mining.

The workshop is a satellite event of the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining.

## Program

The joint program for EdbA and SA4PM workshops at ICPM’22 is available here: <https://icpmconference.org/2022/program/edba-sapm>.


## Submission information

### Important dates

* Workshop abstract submission deadline: ~~August 10, 2022~~ August 17, 2022
* Workshop paper submission deadline: ~~August 17, 2022~~ August 24, 2022
* Paper notification: September 14, 2022
* Pre-Workshop Camera ready: October 5, 2022
* Workshop day: October 24, 2022

_All deadlines correspond to anywhere on earth ('AoE' or 'UTC-12')._

### Guidelines

Authors should submit original, unpublished research papers. All papers must not simultaneously be submitted to another journal or conference. Submitted papers should have a **maximum length of 12 pages** and must be written in English. The abstract is expected to include a relevance indication to the scope of the workshop.

Submitters are **required** to indicate if their data and software is publicly available and if so, where and if not, why not. Sharing both data and software is important for the development of the research area as a whole. We expect this low-impact demand will increase the visibility of our work and the availability of data and software to other researchers.

Authors are requested to prepare submissions according to the format of the [Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series by Springer](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0).

### Submission link

Papers and abstracts should be submitted through the Easy Chair web site in PDF format: <https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icpm2022>.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of them will register to the conference and present the paper. Registrations are managed by the ICPM 2022 registration system (<https://icpmconference.org/2022/registration/>). Only papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference will be published in the conference proceedings.

## Proceedings

The proceedings of the workshops will be published together with the other ICPM workshops as conference proceedings by Springer-Verlag in its Lecture Notes in Business Information Systems (LNBIP) series.
